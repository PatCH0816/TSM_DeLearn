# TSM_DeLearn
This is my personal repo of the deep learning course from the Master of Science in Engineering module "TSM_DeLearn". Deep Learning is one of the most active subareas of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the moment. Gartner has placed it at the peak in its
2017 Hype Cycle and the trend is going on. Deep Learning techniques are based on neural networks. They are at the core of a vast range of
impressive applications, ranging from image classification, automated image captioning, language translation such as Google Translate, to playing Go
and arcade games.
This course focuses on the mathematical aspects of neural networks, their implementation (in Python), and their training and usage. Students will
learn the fundamental concepts of Deep Learning and develop a good understanding of applicability of Deep Learning for Machine Learning tasks.
After completing the course, students will have developed the skills to apply Deep Learning in practical application settings.
